## Why you need it

Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Trae, DSH and other agent tools help you write code and run tasks — while your OpenClaw / XiaoyaoClaw hosts a fleet of agents (tiantong, xiaoguang, xiaozhi...) and multiple channels (Feishu, Telegram...). **When you want an external agent to command OpenClaw directly**, you run into:

- ❌ **Command not found** — openclaw is not on PATH (desktop app embeds it), plain `openclaw` errors out
- ❌ **Real agents invisible** — env vars missing, `agents list` shows only `main`
- ❌ **Task goes to the wrong agent** — without `--agent`, it falls back to the default agent
- ❌ **Hardcoded paths** — break when the install location or platform changes

This skill provides a **standardized command channel**: dynamic detection + env-var filling + explicit-agent enforcement + cross-tool universality — any Agent Skills tool can command OpenClaw / XiaoyaoClaw in one go.

## Features

- 🔍 **Dynamic detection** — multi-level probing for the openclaw binary on Windows / macOS / Linux (XiaoyaoClaw desktop → PATH → vanilla desktop → local prefixes), no hardcoded paths
- 🧩 **Auto env-var filling** — derives `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR` / `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH` for desktop installs, so external tools see all real agents
- 🎯 **Explicit agent required** — `--agent` is mandatory; if the user doesn't name one, ask first — never fall back to a default
- 🌐 **Agent name mapping** — Chinese/English/emoji names ↔ ids resolved via the `Identity` field of `agents list`; if no match, ask — never guess
- 🧰 **Cross-tool universal** — works in any tool supporting Agent Skills (Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode / Trae / DSH), commands are fully generic
- 🔌 **Version-agnostic** — works on older openclaw (v2026.3.x) without `mcp`/`migrate`; defers to `--help`
- 🛡️ **No stored credentials** — no tokens/keys in the skill; gateway credentials come from the environment

## Install

```bash
# Manually from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/dtsola/xiaoyaoclaw-commander
# Copy the SKILL.md folder into your tool's skills directory:
#   Claude Code → ~/.claude/skills/
#   Codex       → ~/.codex/skills/
#   Others      → corresponding Agent Skills directory
```

> No need to install into OpenClaw's skills directory — this skill is for **external tools** commanding OpenClaw.

## Usage

1. Put the skill in your tool's skills directory (Claude Code / Codex / OpenCode / Trae / DSH...)
2. Tell the tool "**have tiantong research X**" or "**send a Feishu message via OpenClaw**" — the skill will:
   - Detect the openclaw binary + fill in env vars
   - Map the agent name to its id via `agents list`
   - Run tasks / send messages / check status through the Gateway
3. Query commands: "list the OpenClaw agents", "is the gateway healthy?"

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 steps, 5 minutes)

### Step 1: Install the skill

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dtsola/xiaoyaoclaw-commander
# Windows: copy to %USERPROFILE%\.claude\skills\xiaoyaoclaw-commander\
# macOS:   copy to ~/.claude/skills/xiaoyaoclaw-commander/
```

### Step 2: Delegate a task

Tell your Claude Code / Codex:

> Have tiantong research the release workflow of the xiaoyaoclaw ecosystem

The tool will: detect openclaw → fill env vars → map "天桐" via `agents list` → tiantong → `openclaw agent -m "..." --agent tiantong --json` → return the result.

### Step 3: Verify + more capabilities

- List agents: "which OpenClaw agents exist?" → `openclaw agents list` (with Chinese identities)
- Send a channel message: "send a Feishu message: xxx" → `openclaw message send --channel feishu -t <id> -m "..."`
- Check status: "is the OpenClaw gateway healthy?" → `openclaw health`

### Daily habits

| Scenario | Action |
|---|---|
| Delegate to a specific agent | "Have <name> do X" → auto-mapped id |
| Cross-channel notifications | "send via Feishu/Telegram" → `message send` |
| Team collaboration | `agents list` first to see who's available |
| Unknown agent name | The skill checks Identity and confirms — never guesses |

## How it compares

| | Raw terminal | openclaw mcp serve | **xiaoyaoclaw-commander** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Binary location | manual, error-prone | needs new runtime | ✅ dynamic detection |
| Env vars | manual | needs setup | ✅ auto-filled |
| Runtime version | any | needs v2026.8+ | ✅ any version |
| Agent selection | default fallback risk | DIY | ✅ explicit + name mapping |
| Tool support | terminal only | MCP clients only | ✅ any Agent Skills tool |
| Skill standard | — | — | ✅ Agent Skills open standard |
